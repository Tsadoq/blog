Matteo here! I'm **Matteo Villosio**, Computer engineer and currently Data Science M.Sc. Student @ [Polito](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en). I attained my bachelor in Computer Engineering after graduating from the Polytechnic University of Turin. During my B.Sc. I followed multiple summer courses in the UK and the US to improve my knowledge of English language and society. I moreover attended courses about history of the middle east to broad my horizons outside my academic field.

I interned in an IT consultancy firm, EisWorld, working on the development of a multiplatform webapp for compliance management.

I attended the [Classical Lyceum "G.F. Porporato"](), at the time part of an experimental program with increased math. There, I had a all around preparation with a focus on Ancient Greek, Latin and, in general, Classical Culture.

I love hiking and mountaineering (check my instagram for some pics of my hikes), reading, history (I'm a big history nerd) and, as everyone, traveling. I eat only the food of the place i visit.
